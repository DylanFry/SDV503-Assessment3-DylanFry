## The Problem
The local District Health Board wants a new Patient Health Record Managment System to store, manage and give access to a patient's health information such as their medical history, diagnoses, medications, and test results. 
## Project Goals
This project aims to create that desired system in a timely and well-developed manner using the agile extreme programming (XP) software development methodology.
## Scope
This project entails the planning, design, and development of a proof of concept for the system using JavaScipt and the terminal through Node.JS. The project will then be completed by creating user documentation.
## Tracking Progress
Agile XP project managment tracks progress through short, weekly iterations that are reviewed before the next iteration begins. For this project, after each week is complete (Each Monday), the progress that has been made over the past week will be reviewed and the future tasks will be reviewed against the remaining time to determine if the progress is on track.
